= vagrant-centos7-artifactory
:author: Steve Taylor <Steve.Taylor@taybiz.com>

An example of using vagrant, and some puppet, to spin up an Artifactory box using a CentOS7 machine.

WARNING: This turns down the firewalld service to use the service on http://localhost:18111.

This uses a plugin to keep the virtualbox extension noise/warnings to a minimum
# vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

To use an internal proxy. Handy for caching all the goodness these things use.
# vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf

Once this spins up ('vagrant up'), you should be able to go to http://localhost:18081.

The default username and password are 'admin' and 'password'. Change those.
